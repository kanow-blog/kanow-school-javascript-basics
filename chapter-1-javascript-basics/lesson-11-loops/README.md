# Loops

## Tasks

> Printing should look like that: **_`console.log('TASK-1', value);`_**

- **[TASK-1]** Create a loop that will print all keys of the object (use **_for ... in_**). For example if we are having such object:

  ```javascript
  var person = {
    firstName: "Jan",
    lastName: "Kowalski",
    age: 21,
  };
  ```

  function should print: **_firstName_**, **_lastName_** and **_age_**

- **[TASK-2]** Create two loops that will print all array values (use **_for ... of_** for first function and regular **_for_** for second function)
- **[TASK-3]** Create a loop that will print the values of an array until it reaches the middle of an array (use **_while_**)
- **[TASK-4]** Create a loop that will print every second value of an array (use **_continue_**)
- **[TASK-5]** Create a loop that will print all elements of an array but will finish the work if element value equals 4 (use **_break_**)
- **[TASK-6]** Create a loop that will print all odd numbers of an array (use **_forEach_**)

- **[QUESTION-2]** If you will have a task to iterate over  all array elements and do something with those elements with specified keys which loop you would use?
- **[QUESTION-3]** Which loop is the most intuitive for you and which is the least intuitive
