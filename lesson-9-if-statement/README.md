# If statement

## Tasks

> After finishing each TASK use the function you have created and print the result of this function. I encourage you to try to use different values as parameters to get different results (print results of all examples you have made).
>
> Printing should look like that: **_`console.log('TASK-1', result);`_**

- **[TASK-1]** Create a function which will take one parameter and then:

  - If parameter is divisible by 2 print **_Divisible by 2_**
  - If parameter is divisible by 3 print **_Divisible by 3_**
  - If parameter is not divisible by 2 or 3 then print **_Not divisible by 2 or 3_**

- **[TASK-2]** Create a function which will take one parameter and then:

  - If parameter is divisible by 2 print **_Divisible by 2_**
  - If parameter is divisible by 3 print **_Divisible by 3_**
  - If parameter is divisible by 4 print **_Divisible by 4_**
  - If parameter is divisible by 5 print **_Divisible by 5_**

- **[TASK-3]** Create a function which will take one parameter then check does parameter is even number if yes return **`'Even number'`** otherwise return **`Odd number`** (use **_ternary operator_**)
