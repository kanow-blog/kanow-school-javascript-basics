# Loops

## Tasks

> After finishing each TASK use the function you have created and print the result of this function. I encourage you to try to use different values as parameters to get different results (print results of all examples you have made).
>
> Printing should look like that: **_`console.log('TASK-1', result);`_**

- **[TASK-1]** Create a function that will print all keys of the object (use **_for ... in_**). For example if we are having such object:

  ```javascript
  var person = {
    firstName: "Jan",
    lastName: "Kowalski",
    age: 21,
  };
  ```

  function should print: **_firstName_**, **_lastName_** and **_age_**

- **[TASK-2]** Create a two functions that will print all array values (use **_for ... of_** for first function and regular **_for_** for second function)
- **[TASK-3]** Create a function that will print the values of an array until it reaches the middle of an array (use **_while_**)
- **[TASK-4]** Create a function that will print every second value of an array (use **_continue_**)
- **[TASK-5]** Create a function that will print all elments of an array but will finish the work if element value equals 4 (use **_break_**)
