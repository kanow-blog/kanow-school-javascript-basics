# Functions

## Tasks

> After finishing each TASK use the function you have created and print the result of this function. I encourage you to try to use different values as parameters to get different results (print results of all examples you have made).
>
> Printing should look like that: **_`console.log('TASK-1', result);`_**

- **[TASK-1]** Create a function which will take 2 parameters and divide them then after division will be done print the result of the division operation inside this function body
- **[TASK-2]** Create a function which will take 2 parameters and multiply them then when you get the result of the multiplication return this result from this function body
- **[TASK-3]** Create a variable which will store a function which will take 2 parameters and count the difference of those 2 parameters
- **[TASK-4]** Create a variable that stores an arrow function which will take 1 number parameters, increase it by 6 and return then check does this parameter increased by 6 is an even number if yes return **`true`** otherwise return **`false`**
- **[TASK-5]** Create a variable that stores an arrow function which will take 2 string parameters, concatenate them into one and return (do not use `{ ... }` to define function body)
