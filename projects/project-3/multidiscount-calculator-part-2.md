# Multidiscount calculator

> Part 2

## Description

In this part, we will convert codebase to TypeScript and add code static analysis tools like eslint and prettier

## Setting up

Reuse you old project and follow below instructions

1. Copy all files from [***refactoring-config***](./refactoring-config) to root of your project
2. Run `npm install` in the root of the project
3. Make sure that you root Application component is called **`MultidiscountCalculator`**
4. Run `npm run start` to start you application under [***http://localhost:5173/***](http://localhost:5173/)

## Requirements

1. Running `npm run typecheck` doesn't produce any errors
2. Running `npm run lint` doesn't produce any errors
3. Running `npm run build` creates a valid build that can be used by the end user

  - Think about your project files organization. Maybe create one file for all interfaces, one for all the enums or
    maybe keep interfaces and enums connected with their source class/components
